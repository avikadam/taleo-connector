Taleo’s solutions primarily focus on talent acquisition (recruitment), performance management, learning and development, and compensation management. These capabilities combine to provide what Taleo calls “Talent Intelligence,” or an enhanced level of insight into candidates and employees. This connector allows you to interact with it using the taleo bussines edition. For more details check [Taleo documentation](http://tbe.taleo.net/products/TBE_API_Guide.pdf)
